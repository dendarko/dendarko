# Hi, I'm Dennis Darko 👋

I'm a Machine Learning & AI Engineer and MLOps Specialist based in North Vancouver, Canada, with over seven years of experience designing, deploying and maintaining scalable AI solutions. I specialize in generative AI, large language models and retrieval‑augmented generation applications, as well as MLOps, data engineering and cloud‑native deployments.

## ⚙️ What I Do

- Build and fine‑tune state‑of‑the‑art ML and deep learning models for NLP, computer vision and recommendation systems.
- Develop retrieval‑augmented generation pipelines using LangChain, vector databases and Hugging Face transformers.
- Implement MLOps workflows, CI/CD pipelines and monitoring with tools like MLflow, DVC, Kubernetes and Grafana.
- Design end‑to‑end data pipelines and scalable ETL processes across GCP, AWS and Azure.
- Collaborate with cross‑functional teams to translate business challenges into data‑driven solutions.

## 🧐 Featured Projects

- **TransCostML:** Transport price estimation pipeline combining data extraction, preprocessing, ensemble modeling (Random Forest, XGBoost, stacking) and MLflow tracking.
- **Gomat Markup Optimization:** Conversion and markup optimization models with CatBoost and FastAPI, integrated with CI/CD and deployed via Azure ML Studio.
- **GoSource Routing Optimization:** Route optimization CLI and API using Google OR‑Tools, with automated QA and Slack notifications.
- **Ads Recommendation System:** Real-time ads recommendation engine built on GCP Vertex AI and BigQuery.
- **Participedia Capstone:** Multi‑task learning pipeline built on DistilBERT with Kubernetes and DVC orchestration.
