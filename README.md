# Hi, I'm Dennis Darko 👋

I'm a Machine Learning & AI Engineer and MLOps Specialist based in North Vancouver, Canada, with over seven years of experience designing, deploying and maintaining scalable AI solutions. I specialize in generative AI, large language models and retrieval-augmented generation applications, as well as MLOps, data engineering and cloud-native deployments.

## What I Do

**Generative AI & NLP**: Build and fine-tune large language models and transformer-based systems; design prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines using LangChain and vector databases; create summarization and Q&A systems.

**Machine Learning Engineering**: Develop end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion and feature engineering to model training and evaluation; work with traditional ML and deep learning frameworks including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CatBoost and DistilBERT.

**MLOps & LLMOps**: Implement CI/CD workflows, experiment tracking, model registry and data versioning using MLflow, DVC, Airflow, Vertex AI, Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions; deploy models across cloud platforms (Azure ML, AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI) and monitor them using Grafana, Prometheus and Cloud Logging.

**Data Engineering**: Design and maintain robust ETL/ELT pipelines on BigQuery, BigQuery, Dataflow and cloud functions; build and manage data warehouses, lakes and lakehouses; ensure data quality, scalability and reliability.

**Project Leadership & Collaboration**: Collaborate with cross-functional teams to align AI solutions with business goals; lead projects from conception to deployment; mentor team members and promote best practices in Agile development.
